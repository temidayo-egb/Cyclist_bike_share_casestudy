I am  a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members.

# Characters and teams

● Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more
likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

● Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

● Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. I joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals—as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.

● Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

# About the company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

# Ask

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

# Prepare

I Used Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. Download the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data here " https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html" . (Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc.) This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that you won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

# Process

Then, I processed my data for analysis using the following Case Study Roadmap as a guide:

Case Study Roadmap - Process

results?

 Key tasks
● Check the data for errors.
● Choose your tools.
● Transform the data so you can work with it effectively.
● Document the cleaning process

 Deliverable
● Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data


# Analyze

Now that my data is stored appropriately and has been prepared for analysis, I started putting it to work. I UseD the following Case Study Roadmap as a guide:

Guiding questions
● How should you organize your data to perform analysis on it?
● Has your data been properly formatted?
● What surprises did you discover in the data?

I Followed these steps  using SQL
Open your SQL tool of choice(I USED "MY SQL"), then complete the following steps:
1. Import your data.
2. Explore your data, perhaps looking at the total number of rows, distinct values, maximum, minimum, or mean values.
3. Where relevant, use JOIN statements to combine your relevant data into one table.
4. Create summary statistics.
5. Investigate interesting trends and save that information to a table.


# Share

Now that you have performed your analysis and gained some insights into your data, create visualizations to share your findings. Moreno has reminded you that they should be sophisticated and polished in order to effectively communicate to the executive team. Use the following Case Study Roadmap as a guide:

Case Study Roadmap - Share

Guiding questions

● Were you able to answer the question of how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes
differently?
● What story does your data tell?
● How do your findings relate to your original question?
● Who is your audience? What is the best way to communicate with them?
● Can data visualization help you share your findings?
● Is your presentation accessible to your audience?

Key tasks

● Determine the best way to share your findings.
● Create effective data visualizations.
● Present your findings.
● Ensure your work is accessible.

Deliverable

● Supporting visualizations and key findings

Follow these steps:
1. Take out a piece of paper and a pen and sketch some ideas for how you will visualize
the data.
2. Once you choose a visual form, open your tool of choice to create your visualization.
Use a presentation software, such as PowerPoint or Google Slides, your spreadsheet
program, Tableau, or R.
3. Create your data visualization, remembering that contrast should be used to draw your
audience’s attention to the most important insights. Use artistic principles including
size, color, and shape.
4. Ensure clear meaning through the proper use of common elements, such as headlines,
subtitles, and labels.
5. Refine your data visualization by applying deep attention to detail.

# Act
RECOMMENDATIONS :

From the analysis performed on the data provided, I have the following recommendations:

1. Have a advertising campaign to casual riders leading into the summer months

2. Inform the casual riders how much they can save if they were to convert to a member by providing promotions throughout the year such as a free trial or a discount throughout the summer months.

3. Create a reward program to the members and that might help incentavise the casual user to become a member

4.Make docked bikes avaliable in the annual membership
